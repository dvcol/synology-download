> Synology Download is a React base Chrome extension to manage Synology Download Station tasks directly from the browser.

> The popup support the following functionalities
>
> * Tabbed download tasks display and filtering
> * Task pause, play, seed, delete, destination edit
> * Task creation through rich form (destination, url, ftp, zip password)
> * Http, Https, 2FA login over local network
> * Context menu creation (with custom destination)
> * Quick action menu creation (with custom destination)

> The content script supports the following functionalities:
>
> * One click download on magnet links
> * Quick menu dropdown if more than one exist
> * Rich task creation modal on quick action or context menu
> * In-page notification for task creation

> The service worker supports the following functionalities:
>
> * Periodic task polling
> * Custom badge number and text display for filtered tasks (by tabs, status, destination)
> * Browser notifications on task completion/error (conditional on polling behavior and extensions permissions)

## Limitation

> Quick-connect login is not currently supported due to the lack of official API documentation.
>
> Currently, only magnet urls are supported for the quick action menu.
>
> Note that translation on previous version of Chrome (100 and below) might have only partial support in banner notifications.
>
> Due to MV3 current limitation, the service-worker is maintained awake through periodic messaging on active tab, if no tab is active in the past 5 minutes, service worker and associated functionalities might suspend until wake events.
